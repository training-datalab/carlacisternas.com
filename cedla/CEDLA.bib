  abstract = {This paper attempts to comment empirically upon certain assumptions about the relationship between social background patterns and attitudinal patterns in elite analysis. All political systems are more or less stratified and their elites constitute that minority of participating actors which plays a strategic role in public policy making. As the incumbents of such key positions they have a far greater influence than the masses in structuring and giving expression to political relationships and policy outputs at various levels of authoritative decision making. They wield this influence by virtue of their exceptional access to political information and positions and their consequently highly disproportionate control over public policy making and communication processes which relate society to polity and governors to governed.Usually exceeding no more than about five percent of the members of a political community, such elites not only know a good deal more about the internal workings of the pertinent system than do the rest of its members, but they can do a good deal more to give shape and content to general input demands and supports, as well as to formal governmental rulings at the national or sub-national level. Therefore, their behavior patterns represent a crucial dimension of behavior patterns in a political system, providing important clues to characteristics making it like or unlike other systems.},

A pesar de su autoproclamado apoliticismo el estamento tecnocrático se ha constituido en un actor estratégico en los intentos de legitimación de los diversos proyectos políticos de este período. Partiendo del debate existente sobre el fenómeno tecnocrático en las sociedades modernas se subraya una serie de características particulares del caso chileno tales como: la gestación de un estamento tecnocrático que antecede al proceso de industrialización; la fuerte vinculación existente entre las clases medias y el auge del ideario tecnocrático en el país, y la existencia de una tecnocracia estatal que ha jugado en diversas ocasiones un rol moderador entre fuerzas políticas y sociales que se enfrentan abiertamente en la lucha por el poder&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstract  = {The failure of market reforms in Latin America to produce sustained growth and equitable prosperity is demonstrated most clearly by Argentina's most recent economic and political meltdown. But economic difficulties, poverty and searing inequality has continued to plague the Mexican case as well. Latin American policy makers themselves have begun to contribute to the growing discussion of policies necessary to confront the lingering economic and social challenges. Included among the recommended policy prescriptions are increased social spending, supported by tax reform, assistance to small and medium enterprise, and an end to corruption. Such policy reforms require governments that are autonomous from particular business interests with established institutional channels capable of securing generalized business cooperation and support. This article argues that the market reform experiences of Argentina and Mexico reinforced preexisting power structures and political practices, strengthening the economic clout and personalized political access of the owners of powerful holding companies, a situation diametrically opposed to the sort of business state relations conducive to further essential reforms. As the case of Argentina illustrates, this sort of skewed policy influence is liable to generate strong opposition and resistance to the market model.},
