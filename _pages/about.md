<p align="justify">I am a PhD Researcher in the Department of Latin American Studies at the Faculty of Humanities at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/" target="_blank">Leiden University</a>, Netherlands. I am also a Lecturer in the School of Business at the <a href="https://www.umayor.cl/um/facultades/humanidades/10000" target="_blank">Faculty of Humanities</a> at the Universidad Mayor, Chile. </p>

<p align="justify">I hold an MA (1st) in Political Science from the <a href="http://www.inap.uchile.cl/" target="_blank">Institute of Public Affairs</a>  at the Universidad de Chile. Moreover, I earned a BA (1st) and a BPS (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago.</p>

<p align="justify">I am interested in technocracy in Latin America, public policies and legislative processes, social network analysis, and mixed methods. My doctoral project is supervised by <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/patricio-silva#tab-1" target="_blank">Professor Patricio Silva</a> and focuses on the relationship between technocracy, democracy and sociopolitical conflicts in Chile.</p>
